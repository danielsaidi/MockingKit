## About MockingKit

MockingKit is a Swift-based mocking library that makes it easy to mock protocols and classes, for instance when unit testing or mocking not yet implemented functionality.

MockingKit lets you `register` function results, `invoke` functions and `inspect` calls.

MockingKit doesn't put any restrains on your code or require you to structure it in any way. You don't need any setup or configuration. Just create a mock and you're good to go.



## Supported Platforms

MockingKit supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 10.15`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.



## Installation

MockingKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/MockingKit.git
```

or with CocoaPods:

```
pod MockingKit
```

You can also clone the repository and build the library locally.



## Getting started

The online documentation has a [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] that will help you get started with the library.



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library.

The online documentation is currently iOS-specific. To generate documentation for other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.
