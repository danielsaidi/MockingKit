 This class can be inherited when creating a mock class that
 doesn't have to inherit another class.
 
 The class implements the ``Mockable`` protocol by returning
 self as the ``mock`` property value.
 
 Inherit the class instead of implementing ``Mockable`` when
 possible. It saves you a little code for each mock you make.
