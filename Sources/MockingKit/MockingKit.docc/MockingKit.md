# ``MockingKit``

MockingKit is a Swift-based mocking library that makes it easy to mock protocols and classes, for instance when unit testing or mocking not yet implemented functionality.


## Overview

![MockingKit logo](Logo.png)

MockingKit lets you `register` function results, `invoke` functions and `inspect` calls.

MockingKit doesn't put any restrains on your code or require you to structure it in any way. You don't need any setup or configuration. Just create a mock and you're good to go.



## Supported Platforms

MockingKit supports `iOS 9`, `macOS 10.10`, `tvOS 9` and `watchOS 6`.



## Installation

MockingKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/MockingKit.git

## License
