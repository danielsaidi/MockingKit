## Overview

![MockingKit logo](Logo.png)

MockingKit is a Swift SDK that lets you easily mock protocols and classes in `Swift`. 

MockingKit lets you create mocks of any protocol or class, after which you can `call` functions, `register` dynamic function results, automatically `record` method invocations, and `inspect` all recorded calls.

MockingKit doesn't require any setup or build scripts, and puts no restrictions on your code or architecture. Just create a mock and you're good to go.
